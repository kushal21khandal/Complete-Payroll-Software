jab tak me data ko ache se smjh nhi jaata me isme kaise kuch aage karu

aur dusari main baat mujhe 2 cheezein seekhni h -> mysql and fileIO operations in java



how about this :
opening  the connection when we type the input 'emp' in the cmd and closing the connection when 'quit/exit' in cmd for emp


// config.main() has to be run on the very first on app.java
        NO NEED FOR RUNNING CONFIG.MAIN() -> changed to all static mode without any external initializaiton


there is no need for clientCSV as all the data will be uploaded in one csv file using code only



this is on how to add logs to a .log file in java
    public static final Logger logger  = Logger.getLogger("autowork");
    private FileHandler logFile = null;

    Cmd(){

        try {
            logFile = new FileHandler(Config.getPathLogFile());
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        logFile.setFormatter(new SimpleFormatter());
        logger.addHandler(logFile);
    }


    # DO not forget to close the fileHandler connection
